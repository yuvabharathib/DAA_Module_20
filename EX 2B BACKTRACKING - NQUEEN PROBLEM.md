# EX 2B BACKTRACKING - NQUEEN PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To solve the N-Queen problem using backtracking, which places N queens on an N*N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.


## Algorithm
1. Take input `N` representing the size of the chessboard (NÃ—N) and the number of queens to place.  
2. Initialize a 2D list `board` with all zeros to represent the chessboard.  
3. Define a function `isSafe` that checks if a queen can be safely placed at position `(row, col)` by checking the left row, upper-left diagonal, and lower-left diagonal.  
4. Define a recursive function `solveNQUtil` that tries to place queens column by column.  
5. If the current column index `col` is equal to or exceeds `N`, return `True` indicating all queens are placed.  
6. For each row in the current column, check if placing a queen at `(i, col)` is safe using `isSafe`.  
7. If safe, place the queen by setting `board[i][col] = 1` and recursively call `solveNQUtil` for the next column.  
8. If the recursive call returns `True`, propagate the success; otherwise, backtrack by setting `board[i][col] = 0`.  
9. If no safe position is found in the current column, return `False`.  
10. In `solveNQ`, call `solveNQUtil` with the initial board and column 0; if successful, print the board; otherwise, print that no solution exists.
